# SURGETK - Surge Tank: Absorb a Burst of STDIN and Output It Smoothly
#
# USAGE   : surgetk [-s|-o|-d] [-v] [-m fd|file] size
#           surgetk -i
# Args    : size ........ Capacity (in bytes) of the ring buffer which
#                         absorbs the bytes that have arrived at the
#                         standard input but have not been sent to the
#                         standard output yet.
#                         The unit is byte defaultly. You can also
#                         specify the unit like '10MiB'. Available
#                         units are 'B', 'kB', 'KB', 'KiB', 'MB',
#                         'MiB', 'GB', 'GiB'. ("kB" means 1000 bytes;
#                         "KB" and "KiB" both mean 1024 bytes.)
# Options : -s .......... (Default) Suspend mode. When the ring buffer
#                         is full and a new byte arrives, block the
#                         reading of the standard input until a slot
#                         becomes free.
#           -o .......... Overwrite mode. When the ring buffer is
#                         full, discard the oldest unsent byte and
#                         store the new one instead.
#           -d .......... Disconnect mode. When the ring buffer is
#                         full, terminate this command immediately
#                         without sending any of the buffered bytes.
#                         (-s, -o and -d are exclusive to each other.
#                          If you set two or more, the last one will
#                          be valid.)
#           -v .......... Verbose mode. Reports overflow events and
#                         internal behavior to the standard error.
#                         Giving this option two or more times raises
#                         the verbosity level.
#           -m fd|file .. Report the current fill level of the ring
#                         buffer on demand. Give either a file
#                         descriptor number (which must already be
#                         open for writing, e.g. inherited from the
#                         shell) or a file path (which will be opened
#                         for appending, creating it if necessary;
#                         an existing file's content is kept and the
#                         new lines are added after it, since this is
#                         timestamped log data).
#                         Whenever this process receives a SIGUSR1,
#                         it writes one line formatted as
#                         "<UNIX time> <PID> <bytes used> <capacity>"
#                         (space-separated, capacity in bytes; the UNIX
#                         time has millisecond precision, printed with
#                         exactly 3 digits after the decimal point,
#                         e.g. "1759381200.123") to that destination
#                         and flushes it. No report
#                         is produced unless this option is given,
#                         and nothing is written spontaneously; it is
#                         purely on-demand. (If you want periodic
#                         reports, send SIGUSR1 periodically yourself,
#                         e.g. "while sleep 1; do kill -USR1 $PID;
#                         done".)
#                         The 2nd field is this process's own PID, so
#                         multiple surgetk processes can safely share
#                         the same destination file (opened with
#                         O_APPEND; see above) and still be told apart
#                         in the merged output.
#           -i .......... Investigation mode. Instead of doing the
#                         surge-tank operation, investigate the sizes
#                         of the various OS/libc buffers that a byte
#                         passes through around this command (see the
#                         manual for the details of each), print them
#                         to the standard output, and exit immediately.
#                         This overrides all the other options, and
#                         the "size" argument becomes unnecessary.
#                         The output format is one buffer per line,
#                         "name size(in bytes)" separated by a space,
#                         with the size column right-aligned.
#                         A buffer whose size this command failed to
#                         determine (e.g. one that is unsupported on
#                         the running OS) is simply omitted.
# Retuen  : Return 0 when finished successfully (the standard input
#           reached EOF and the buffer was completely flushed, or the
#           "-i" investigation finished).
#           Return 1 when this command was forced to disconnect by
#           the "-d" option.
