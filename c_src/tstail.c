# TSTAIL - A "tail" Command Which Considers Timestamp Instead of
#          the Number of Lines
#
# USAGE   : (a) tstail [options] -d    duration      [file ...]
#           (b) tstail [options] -xd   duration      [file ...]
#           (c) tstail [options] -d   -duration      [file ...]
#           (d) tstail [options] -xd  -duration      [file ...]
#           (e) tstail [options] -t    date-and-time [file ...]
#           (f) tstail [options] -xt   date-and-time [file ...]
#           ("-x" must not be fused after "-d"/"-t" in the same token,
#            e.g. "-dx" is NOT "-d" + "-x" but "-d" with the argument
#            "x". Write it as "-xd"/"-xt", or as two separate options
#            such as "-d -x" or "-x -d".)
#
#           The lines that can pass through this command will be chosen
#           by making sure the timestamp at the first field of each line
#           is in one of the following ranges.
#             (a) [ <last line's time>-<duration>,  <bottom> ]
#             (b) ( <last line's time>-<duration>,  <bottom> ]
#             (c) [ <1st line's time>  +<duration>,  <bottom> ]
#             (d) ( <1st line's time>  +<duration>,  <bottom> ]
#             (e) [ date-and-time,                   <bottom> ]
#             (f) ( date-and-time,                   <bottom> ]
#           When two or more files are given, they are treated as if
#           they were a single concatenated stream (like "cat"), so
#           <1st line's time> means the first line of the FIRST file,
#           and <bottom>/<last line's time> mean the last line of the
#           LAST file.
#
#           NOTE: Since <bottom> is always the last line of the input,
#           this command cannot produce any output until it reaches the
#           end of the input (EOF), no matter which pattern is used.
#           Therefore, this command is NOT suitable for an unbounded,
#           never-ending stream such as one from "tail -f".
#
# Args    : file ........ Filepath to be send ("-" means STDIN)
#                         The file MUST be a textfile and MUST have
#                         a timestamp at the first field to make the
#                         timing of flow. The first space character
#                         <0x20> of every line will be regarded as
#                         the field delimiter.
# Options : -c,-e,-I,-z . Specify the format for timestamp and -t option
#                         parameter. You can choose one of the following.
#                           -c ... "YYYYMMDDhhmmss[.n]" (default)
#                                  Calendar time (standard time) in your
#                                  timezone (".n" is the digits under
#                                  second. You can specify up to nano
#                                  second.)
#                           -e ... "n[.n]"
#                                  The number of seconds since the UNIX
#                                  epoch (".n" is the same as -c)
#                           -I ... "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[,n][{{+|-}hh:mm|Z}]"
#                                  Ext. ISO 8601 formatted time in your
#                                  timezone (".n" is the same as -c)
#                           -z ... "n[.n]"
#                                  The number of seconds elapsed since the
#                                  timestamped data started being produced
#                                  (".n" is the same as -c)
#           -d duration . This is one of options to specify the timestamp
#                         range. (See the pattern (a) to (d) above)
#                         You can use the format "A[.B][u]" as the
#                         option's parameter "duration."
#                           "A" is the integer part of the time.
#                           "B" is the decimal part of the time.
#                           "u" is the unit for the time. You can choose
#                               one of the followings.
#                               "s", "ms", "us", "ns", "m", "h" and "d."
#           -t date-and-time
#                         This is one of options to specify the timestamp
#                         range. (See the pattern (e) and (f) above)
#                         The format of "date-and-time" depends on
#                         which of the option "-c", "-e," "-I," or "-z"
#                         you choose.
#                           "-c" ... "YYYYMMDDhhmmss[.n]" (cal. time)
#                           "-e" ... "n[.n]" (UNIX time)
#                           "-I" ... "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[,n][{{+|-}hh:mm|Z}]"
#                                    (ext. ISO 8601 time)
#                           "-z" ... "n[.n]" (elapsed sec. since data start)
#           -q .......... Suppresses printing filenames when two or more
#                         files are given.
#           -u .......... Set the date in UTC when -c option is set
#                         (same as that of date command)
#           -x .......... An additional option for -d and -t. It will
#                         exclude the border endpoint itself (the start
#                         of the range) from the output.
#                         (See the pattern (b), (d) and (f) above)
#           -Z .......... Only meaningful for pattern (c)/(d) (i.e. "-d"
#                         with a leading "-"), where the border is
#                         normally "the 1st line's time" + duration. With
#                         this option, the border becomes "time zero" +
#                         duration instead, where "time zero" means the
#                         UNIX epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC) for the
#                         "-c"/"-e"/"-I" formats, or the data's own
#                         reference point (see "-z" above) for the "-z"
#                         format. For any other pattern, "-Z" is silently
#                         ignored. This option also lets this command
#                         skip opening the 1st file just to read its
#                         first line, since the border no longer depends
#                         on it.
# Retuen  : Return 0 only when finished successfully for all files
