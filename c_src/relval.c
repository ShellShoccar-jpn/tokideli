# RELVAL - Limit the Flow Rate of the UNIX Pipeline Like a Relief Valve
#
# USAGE   : relval [-c|-e|-I|-z] [-ku] [-d fd|file] ratelimit   [file [...]]
#           relval [-c|-e|-I|-z] [-ku] [-d fd|file] controlfile [file [...]]
# Args    : file ........ Filepath to be sent ("-" means STDIN)
#                         The file MUST be a textfile and MUST have
#                         a timestamp at the first field to make the
#                         timing of flow. The first space character
#                         <0x20> of every line will be regarded as
#                         the field delimiter.
#                         And, the string from the top of the line to
#                         the charater will be cut before outgoing to
#                         the stdout.
#           ratelimit ... Dataflow limit. You can specify it by the
#                         following two methods.
#                           1. interval time
#                              * One line will be allowed to pass through
#                                in the time you specified.
#                              * The usage is "time[unit]."
#                                - "time" is the numerical part. You
#                                  can use an integer or a decimal.
#                                - "unit" is the part of the unit of time.
#                                  You can choose one of "s," "ms," "us,"
#                                  "ns," "m," "h," or "d." The default
#                                  is "s."
#                              * If you set "1.24ms," this command
#                                allows up to one line of the source
#                                textdata to pass through every 1.24
#                                milliseconds.
#                           2. number per time
#                              * Text data of a specified number of lines
#                                are allowed to pass through in a specified
#                                time.
#                              * The usage is "number/time."
#                                - "number" is the part to specify the
#                                  numner of lines. You can set only a
#                                  natural number from 1 to 65535.
#                                - "/" is the delimiter to seperate
#                                  parts. You must insert any whitespace
#                                  characters before and after this slash
#                                  letter.
#                                - "time" is the part that specifies
#                                  the period. The usage is the same as
#                                  the interval time we explained above.
#                              * If you set "10/1.5," this command
#                                allows up to 10 lines to pass through
#                                every 1.5 seconds.
#           controlfile . Filepath to specify the ratelimit instead of
#                         by argument. You can change the parameter even
#                         when this command is running by updating the
#                         content of the controlfile.
#                         * The parameter syntax you can specify in this
#                           file is completely the same as the argument,
#                           but if you give me an invalid parameter, this
#                           command will ignore it silently with no error.
#                         * The default is "1/86400d" (virtually no line
#                           will pass) unless any valid parameter is given.
#                         * You can choose one of the following three types
#                           as the controlfile.
#                           - Regular file:
#                             If you use a regular file as the control-
#                             file, you have to write a new parameter
#                             into it with the "O_CREAT" mode or ">",
#                             not the "O_APPEND" mode or ">>" because
#                             the command always checks the new para-
#                             meter at the head of the regular file
#                             periodically.
#                             The periodic time of cheking is 0.1 secs.
#                             If you want to apply the new parameter
#                             immediately, send me the SIGHUP after
#                             updating the file.
#                           - Character-special file / Named-pipe:
#                             It is better for the performance. If you
#                             use these types of files, you can write
#                             a new parameter with both the above two
#                             modes. The new parameter will be applied
#                             immediately just after writing.
# Options : -c,-e,-I,-z . Specify the format for timestamp. You can
#                         choose one of them.
#                           -c ... "YYYYMMDDhhmmss[.n]" (default)
#                                  Calendar time (standard time) in your
#                                  timezone (".n" is the digits under
#                                  second. You can specify up to nano
#                                  second.)
#                           -e ... "n[.n]"
#                                  The number of seconds since the UNIX
#                                  epoch (".n" is the same as -x)
#                           -I ... "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[,n][{{+|-}hh:mm|Z}]"
#                                  Ext. ISO 8601 formatted time in your
#                                  timezone (".n" is the same as -x)
#                           -z ... "n[.n]"
#                                  The number of seconds since this
#                                  command has startrd (".n" is the
#                                  same as -x)
#           -u .......... Set the date in UTC when -c option is set
#                         (same as that of date command)
#           -k .......... Keep the timestamp when outputting each line.\n
#           -d fd|file .. If you set this option, the lines that will be
#                         dropped will be sent to the specified file
#                         descriptor or file.
#                         * When you set an integer, this command regards
#                           it as a file descriptor number. If you want
#                           to specify the file in the current directory
#                           that has a numerical filename, you have to
#                           add "./" before the name, like "./3."
#                         * When you set another type of string, this
#                           command regards it as a filename.
#
# Return  : Return 0 only when finished successfully
