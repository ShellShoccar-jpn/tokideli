# DELAY - Delay Each Byte from STDIN for a Certain Time Before Output
#
# USAGE   : delay [-s|-o|-d] [-v] [size@]time
#           delay [-s|-o|-d] [-v] controlfile
# Args    : time ........ Delay time from when a byte arrives at the
#                         standard input to when it is sent to the
#                         standard output.
#                         The unit of the delay time is second
#                         defaultly. You can also specify the unit
#                         like '100ms'. Available units are 's', 'ms',
#                         'us', 'ns', 'm', 'h', 'd'. "0" means no delay.
#           size ........ Size of the ring buffer which holds the
#                         bytes that have arrived but have not been
#                         sent yet. The unit is byte defaultly. You
#                         can also specify the unit like '10MiB'.
#                         Available units are 'B', 'kB', 'KB', 'KiB',
#                         'MB', 'MiB', 'GB', 'GiB'. ("kB" means 1000
#                         bytes; "KB" and "KiB" both mean 1024 bytes.)
#                         You have to add "@" just after this
#                         parameter to distinguish it from the time
#                         parameter. The default is "1MiB" if omitted.
#           controlfile . Filepath to specify the time/size instead of
#                         by argument. You can change the parameters
#                         even when this command is running by
#                         updating the content of the controlfile.
#                         * The syntax you can write in this file is
#                           "{time|size@time|size@}." Either part may
#                           be omitted to leave it unchanged, but if
#                           you give me an invalid parameter, this
#                           command will ignore it silently with no
#                           error. If "size@time" is given, both parts
#                           must be valid, or the whole line is ignored.
#                         * The default is time=0, size=1MiB unless
#                           any valid parameter is given.
#                         * You can choose one of the following three
#                           types as the controlfile.
#                           - Regular file:
#                             If you use a regular file as the control-
#                             file, you have to write a new parameter
#                             into it with the "O_CREAT" mode or ">",
#                             not the "O_APPEND" mode or ">>" because
#                             the command always checks the new para-
#                             meter at the head of the regular file
#                             periodically.
#                             The periodic time of cheking is 0.1 secs.
#                             If you want to apply the new parameter
#                             immediately, send me the SIGHUP after
#                             updating the file.
#                           - Character-special file / Named-pipe:
#                             It is better for the performance. If you
#                             use these types of files, you can write
#                             a new parameter with both the above two
#                             modes. The new parameter will be applied
#                             immediately just after writing.
# Options : -s .......... (Default) Suspend mode. When the ring buffer
#                         is full and a new byte arrives, block the
#                         reading of the standard input until a slot
#                         becomes free.
#           -o .......... Overwrite mode. When the ring buffer is
#                         full, discard the oldest unsent byte and
#                         store the new one instead.
#           -d .......... Disconnect mode. When the ring buffer is
#                         full, terminate this command immediately
#                         without sending any of the buffered bytes.
#                         (-s, -o and -d are exclusive to each other.
#                          If you set two or more, the last one will
#                          be valid.)
#           -v .......... Verbose mode. Reports overflow events and
#                         internal behavior to the standard error.
#                         Giving this option two or more times raises
#                         the verbosity level.
# Retuen  : Return 0 when finished successfully (the standard input
#           reached EOF and the buffer was completely flushed).
#           Return 1 when this command was forced to disconnect by
#           the "-d" option.
